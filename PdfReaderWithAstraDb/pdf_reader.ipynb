Building on the success of PM SVANidhi Scheme in transforming the \\nlives of street vendors, our Government envisions a scheme to support each \\nyear, over the next five years, the development of 100 weekly ‘haats’ or street food hubs in select cities.  \\nStamp Duty  \\n71. We will encourage states which continue to charge high stamp duty to \\nmoderate the rates for all, and also consider further lowering duties for properties purchased by women. This reform will be made an essential \\ncomponent of urban deve lopment schemes.   14  \\n \\nPriority 6: Energy Security  \\nEnergy Transition  \\n72. In the interim budget, I had announced our strategy to sustain high \\nand more resource -efficient economic growth, along with energy security in \\nterms of availability, accessibility and affordab ility.  We will bring out a policy \\ndocument on appropriate energy transition pathways that balances the \\nimperatives of employment, growth and environmental sustainability.   \\nPM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana  \\n73. In line with the announcement in the interim budget, PM Surya Ghar \\nMuft Bijli Yojana has been launched to install rooftop solar plants to enable 1 \\ncrore households obtain free electricity up to 300 units every month. The \\nscheme has generated remarkable res ponse with more than 1.28 crore \\nregistrations and 14 lakh applications, and we will further encourage it.   \\nPumped Storage Policy  \\n74. A policy for promoting pumped storage projects will be brought out \\nfor electricity storage and facilitating smooth integration  of the growing \\nshare of renewable energy with its variable & intermittent nature in the overall energy mix.  \\nResearch and development of small and modular nuclear reactors  \\n75. Nuclear energy is expected to form a very significant part of the \\nenergy mix for Viksit Bharat. Towards that pursuit, our government will partner with the private sector for (1) setting up Bharat Small Reactors, (2) \\nresearch & development of Bharat Small Modular Reactor, and (3) research & \\ndevelopment of newer technologies for nuclear energy. The R&D funding  \\nannounced in the interim budget will be made available for this sector.   \\nAdvanced Ultra Super Critical Thermal Power Plants  \\n76. The development of indigenous technology for Advanced Ultra Super \\nCritical (AUSC) thermal power plants with  much higher efficiency has been \\ncompleted. A joint venture between NTPC and BHEL will set up a full scale \\n800 MW commercial plant using AUSC technology. The government will \\nprovide the required fiscal support. Moving forward, development of \\nindigenous capacity for the production of high- grade steel and other  15  \\n \\nadvanced metallurgy materials for these plants will result in strong spin -off \\nbenefits for the economy.  \\nRoadmap for ‘hard to abate’ industries  \\n77. A roadmap for moving the ‘hard to abate’ industries from ‘energy \\nefficiency’ targets to ‘emission targets’ will be formulated. Appropriate \\nregulations for transition of these industries from the current ‘Perform, \\nAchieve and Trade’ mode to ‘Indian Carbon Market’ mode will be put in \\nplace.    \\nSupport to traditional micro and small industries  \\n78. An investment- grade energy audit of traditional micro and small \\nindustries in 60 clusters, including brass and ceramic, will be facilitated. Financial support will be provided for shifting them to cleaner forms of \\nenergy and implementation of energy efficiency measures. The scheme will \\nbe replicated in another 100 clusters in the next phase.  \\nPriority 7: Infrastructure  \\nInfrastructure investment by Central Government  \\n79. Significant investment the Central Government has made over the years \\nin building and improving infrastructure has had a strong multiplier effect on the \\neconomy. We will endeavour to maintain strong fiscal support for infrastructure over the next 5 years, in conjunction with imperatives of other priorities and \\nfiscal consolidation.

Our government, through the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit \\nProgramme and other sources, will provide financial support for pro jects with \\nestimated cost of ` 11,500 crore such as the Kosi -Mechi intra -state link and \\n20 other ongoing and new schemes including barrages, river pollution \\nabatement and irrigation projects.  In addition, survey and investigation of \\nKosi related flood mit igation and irrigation projects will be undertaken.   \\n84. Assam grapples with floods every year by the Brahmaputra River and \\nits tributaries, originating outside India.  We will provide assistance to Assam \\nfor flood management and related projects.  \\n85. Himachal Pradesh suffered extensive losses due to floods last year.  \\nOur government will provide assistance to the state for reconstruction and \\nrehabilitation through multilateral development assistance.  \\n86. Uttarakhand too suffered losses due to cloud bursts and massiv e \\nlandslides. We will provide assistance to the state.  \\n87. Recently Sikkim witnessed devastating flash floods and landslides that \\nwreaked havoc across the state.  Our Government will provide assistance to \\nthe state.  \\nTourism  \\n88. Tourism has always been a part of our civilization. Our efforts in \\npositioning India as a global tourist destination will also create jobs, stimulate \\ninvestments and unlock economic opportunities for other sectors. In addition \\nto the measures outlined in the interim budget, I propose the following  \\nmeasures.  \\n89. Vishnupad Temple at Gaya and Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in \\nBihar are of immense spiritual significance. Comprehensive development of  17  \\n \\nVishnupad Temple Corridor and Mahabodhi Temple Corridor will be \\nsupported, modelled on the successful Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor, to \\ntransform them into world class pilgrim and tourist destinations.  \\n90. Rajgir holds immense religious significance for Hindus, Buddhists and \\nJains.  The 20th Tirthankara Munisuvrata templ e in the Jain Temple complex \\nis ancient. The Saptharishi or the 7 hotsprings form a warm water \\nBrahmakund that is sacred. A comprehensive development initiative for \\nRajgir will be undertaken.   \\n91. Our government will support the development  of Nalanda as a tourist \\ncentre besides reviving Nalanda University to its glorious stature.   \\n92.

       " (Document(page_content='Consultative Machinery for Central Government Employees have taken a \\nconstructive approach. A solution will be evolved which addresses the \\nrelevant issues while maintaining fiscal prudence to protect the common \\ncitizens.  \\nBudget Estimates 2024- 25 \\n112. For the year 2024 -25, the total receipts other than borrowings and \\nthe total expenditure are estimated at `  32.07 lakh crore  and ` 48.21 lakh \\ncrore respectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 25.83 lakh crore. \\nThe fiscal deficit is estimated at 4.9 per cent of GDP.   21  \\n \\n113. The gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during \\n2024 -25 are estimated at ` 14.01 lakh crore  and ` 11.63  lakh crore \\nrespectively. Both will be less than that in 2023 -24.  \\n114. The fiscal consolidation path announced by me in 2021 has served our \\neconomy very well, and we aim to reach a deficit below 4.5 per cent next \\nyear. The Government is committed to staying the course. From 2026 -27 \\nonwards, our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that the Central Government debt will be on a declining path as percentage of \\nGDP.  \\nI will, now, move to Part B.  \\n   22  \\n \\nPART B \\nIndirect Taxes  \\n115. I start with GST. It has decreased tax incidence on the common man; \\nreduced compliance burden and logistics cost for trade and industry; and \\nenhanced revenues of the central and state governments. It is a success of \\nvast proportions. To multiply the benefi ts of GST, we will strive to further \\nsimplify and rationalise the tax structure and endeavour to expand it to the remaining sectors.  \\n116. My proposals for customs duties intend to support domestic \\nmanufacturing, deepen local value addition, promote export \\ncompe titiveness, and simplify taxation, while keeping the interest of the \\ngeneral public and consumers surmount.  \\n117. In Budget 2022- 23, we reduced the number of customs duty rates.  \\nI propose to undertake a comprehensive review of the rate structure over the next s ix months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of \\nduty inversion and reduction of disputes.  \\n118. I shall now take up sector specific customs duty proposals.  \\nMedicines and Medical Equipment  \\n119. To provide relief to cancer patients, I propose to fully exempt three \\nmore medicines from customs duties.  \\n120. I also propose changes in the BCD on x -ray tubes & flat panel \\ndetectors for use in medical x -ray machines under the Phased Manufacturing \\nProgramme, so as to synchronise them with domestic capacity addi tion.  \\nMobile Phone and Related Parts  \\n121. With a three -fold increase in domestic production and almost  \\n100- fold jump in exports of mobile phones over the last six years, the India n \\nmobile phone industry has matured. In the interest of consumers, I now propose to reduce the BCD on mobile phone, mobile PCBA and mobile \\ncharger to 15 per cent.  \\n  23  \\n \\nCritical Minerals  \\n122. Minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements are \\ncritic al for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defence, \\ntelecommunications, and high- tech electronics. I propose to  fully exempt \\ncustoms duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce BCD on two of them.  This  \\nwill provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and \\nhelp secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors.   \\nSolar  Energy  \\n123. Energy transition is critical in the fight against climate change. To \\nsupport energy transition, I propose to expand the  list of exempted capital \\ngoods for use in the manufacture of solar cells and panels in the country. \\nFurther, in view of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity of solar glass \\nand tinned copper interconnect, I propose not to extend the  exemption of \\ncustoms duties provided to them.  \\nMarine products  \\n124.
