Yet, we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history, and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my first vision is that of freedom.\n",

       "\"Here is the translation of the speech to French:\\n\\nJe ai trois visions pour l'Inde. Au fil des 3000 ans de notre histoire, des gens de tout le monde sont venus et nous ont envahis, capturés nos terres, conquis nos esprits. À partir d'Alexandre, les Grecs, les Turcs, les Mughals, les Portugais, les Britanniques, les Français et les Pays-Bas sont venus et nous ont pillés, ont pris ce qui était à nous. Pourtant, nous n'avons pas fait cela à d'autres nations. Nous n'avons pas conquis personne. Nous n'avons pas volé leurs terres, leur culture, leur histoire et nous n'avons pas essayé d'imposer notre manière de vivre sur eux. Pourquoi ? Parce que nous respectons la liberté des autres. C'est pourquoi ma première vision est la liberté.\\n\\nJe crois que l'Inde a eu sa première vision de cela en 1857, lors de la guerre d'indépendance. C'est cette liberté que nous devons protéger et nourrir et construire sur. Si nous ne sommes pas libres, personne ne nous respectera.\\n\\nMa seconde vision pour l'Inde est le développement. Pendant cinquante ans, nous avons été une nation en développement. Il est temps que nous voyions nous-mêmes comme une nation développée. Nous sommes parmi les cinq premières nations du monde en termes de PIB. Nous avons un taux de croissance de 10 pour cent dans la plupart des domaines. Nos niveaux de pauvreté diminuent. Nos réalisations sont reconnues à l'échelle mondiale aujourd'hui. Pourtant, nous manquons de confiance en nous-mêmes pour voir nous-mêmes comme une nation développée, autonome et assurée. N'est-ce pas incorrect ?\\n\\nJ'ai une troisième vision. L'Inde doit se dresser contre le monde. Car je crois que si l'Inde ne se dresse pas contre le monde, personne ne nous respectera. Seule la force respecte la force. Nous devons être forts non seulement comme puissance militaire, mais également comme puissance économique. Les deux doivent aller de pair.\\n\\nPourquoi la presse est-elle si négative ici ? Pourquoi sommes-nous en Inde si embarrassés de reconnaître nos propres forces, nos réalisations ? Nous sommes une nation si grande. Nous avons tant d'histoires de réussite incroyables, mais nous refusons de les reconnaître. Pourquoi ?\\n\\nNous sommes les premiers producteurs de lait. Nous sommes le premier en satellites d'observation spatiale. Nous sommes le deuxième producteur de blé. Nous sommes le deuxième producteur de riz. Regardez Dr. Sudarshan, il a transformé le village tribal en unité autosuffisante et autonome. Il y a des millions d'accomplissements comme cela, mais notre presse est obsédée par les mauvaises nouvelles et les échecs et les catastrophes. Pourquoi cette négativité ?\\n\\nJ'étais à Tel Aviv et j'étais en train de lire le journal israélien. C'était le jour suivant de nombreuses attaques et bombardements, et Hamas avait frappé, mais la première page du journal avait la photo d'un gentleman juif qui, en cinq ans, avait transformé sa terre déserte en une ferme d'agrumes. C'était cette photo inspirante que tout le monde se réveillait à voir. Les détails sanglants de meurtres, bombardements, décès étaient à l'intérieur du journal, enterrés parmi les autres nouvelles.\\n\\nEn Inde, nous nous contentons de lire des nouvelles de mort, de maladie, de terrorisme, de crime. Pourquoi sommes-nous si négatifs ? La presse nous ferait croire que nous sommes une nation de faillis. Mais en réalité, nous sommes une nation de réussite, les silencieux accomplis, les visionnaires, les acteurs, les rêveurs. C'est juste que nous avons oublié nos rêves.\\n\\nJe crois en la jeunesse. Vous êtes notre plus grande richesse. La jeunesse a le pouvoir de changer. Vous êtes notre avenir, et l'avenir est entre vos mains. Je veux que vous preniez en charge le défi de transformer l'Inde en une grande nation développée. N'arrêtez pas de rêver. N'abandonnez pas l'espoir. Travaillez dur et ne craignez jamais l'échec. Tant que vous croyez en vous-mêmes et dans vos rêves, rien n'est impossible. Vous êtes les leaders de demain. Rappellez-vous ce que je dis toujours : Rêvez, rêvez, rêvez. Les rêves se transforment en pensées et les pensées résultent en action.\\n\\nAlors, laissons-nous construire une nouvelle Inde, une Inde qui est libre, forte et développée. Chacun de vous a le pouvoir en vous pour façonner notre avenir. Rêvez grand, travaillez dur et plus important encore, ne cessez jamais de croire en vous-mêmes et dans vos rêves.\""

He was truly a \\n“People’s President”, who endeared himsel f to every Indian, particularly the youth. \\nHe was an epitome of simplicity, h onesty and wisdom. Hi s contribution to \\nstrengthening India’s defence and sp ace capabilities is invaluable.  \\nI had many occasions to interact with Dr. Kalam when he was in DRDO and later \\nas the President of India an d every time I was struck by the depth of his knowledge \\nand his sincere desire to transform the lives of the common people.  \\nI would like to quote Shri AB Vajpayee ji on Dr. Kalam, when they were Prime \\nMinister and President respec tively: “After his election to the President of India, \\nDr. Kalam has brought immense grace to it, and also a new sense of purpose  that is \\nall his own. Place and position do not make  a man. A man is made of samskaras. \\nBesides discharging his constitutional resp onsibilities with dig nified quietude, Dr. \\nKalam made Rashtrapati Bhavan the karm abhoomi for his pet concerns, which are \\nalso the Nation’s major concerns-- issues  such as education, development of \\nScience and Technology, rural developme nt, and all-round development of our \\nchildren, who are the most precious asset.  From there he has been transmitting the \\ndream of how to make India a Developed Nation”.  \\nAs President, Dr Kalam personified dignity and optimism throughout India and \\nabroad. He was regarded in every country as a strong promoter of friendship and \\nknowledge. In recognit ion of his contributions , NASA had named a newly \\ndiscovered organism found on the International Space Station after Dr. Kalam in \\n2017.  \\nAt Rashtrapati Bhavan, Dr. Kalam had en couraged bio-diversity in the garden, \\nnurtured medicinal plants and created an herbal and \"spiritual\" garden, which \\nattracted thousands of visitors,  especially school children.  \\nThe former President always spoke of th e need for India to become a developed \\nnation given the vast natural resources a nd the talented pool of human resources in \\ndiverse fields. He was convinced that In dia has the potentia l as well as the \\ncapability to become a developed nation in the near future.  \\nIn fact, Dr. Kalam generated Vision for ea ch State in the form of Display Charts. \\nHe invited the MPs to the Rashtrapati Bh avan and explained to them the value, \\ncore competence and development schemes of their States. His biggest passion was \\nto motivate and inspire sc hool and college students to work with a passion for \\nnation-building activities.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='With a median age of less than 30 years, In dia is among the youngest nations in an \\naging world. This youth energy should  be channelized positively for nation-\\nbuilding. I am sure that the recently launched New Educatio n Policy is a step in the \\nright direction and will help India train its students to meet the 21st century needs.  \\nAnother area that Dr. Kalam passionately ad vocated is the need to bridge the rural \\nand urban divide. His PURA model - Prov iding Urban Amenities in Rural Areas – \\nlaid emphasis on enhancing connectivity and building village clusters to spur \\neconomic development. Pradhan Mantri Gr am Sadak Yojana launched during then \\nPrime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’ s tenure and Bharat Net project being \\nsteered under the leadership of current Pr ime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi are two \\nvisionary programs aimed at connectin g our villages with the mainstream.  \\nThe pain of the exodus of migrant workers due to Covid-19 pandemic reminds us \\nof the need to create employment and econom ic opportunities in villages and small \\ntowns. For this, we will have to focus on  decentralized planni ng, capacity building \\nof local bodies and large scale promotion of cottage industries so that our villages \\nand towns emerge as growth centers.  \\nDr. Kalam established a unique place in the  hearts of Indians as the People’s \\nPresident. He was a staunch nationalist, an  inspiring orator and a prolific writer. \\nWhat made him an inspiring and much -loved leader was the human side of \\nKalam’s personality which touched so many lives.  \\nI strongly believe that the ultimate ai m of science and t echnology is to make \\npeople’s lives better. Once, during his vi sit to NIMS in Hyderabad, Dr. Kalam was \\nmoved to see polio-stricken children f acing difficulty in walking with heavy \\ncalipers made of leather, wood and steel.  Space scientist in him could instantly \\nvisualize how to cut the weight and make th ose prosthetic legs  lighter. Soon his \\nteam was able to reduce the weight of the  caliper from 3 kilogram to 300 grams by \\nusing advanced composite material used in rockets.  \\nLater on, Dr Kalam had commented, \"Whe n I see children run around and cycle \\nwith the artificial limbs we de signed, it is sheer bliss.\"  \\nNot only this, he also worked with cardi ologist Soma Raju, and developed a low-\\ncost coronary stent - the \\'Kalam-Raju Sten t\\'. He always wanted society to benefit \\nfrom the spinoffs of defence and space technologies.  \\nI am happy to note that during the ong oing Covid-19 pandem ic our scientific \\ncommunity has come up with many innova tions. India had zero production \\ncapacity for PPEs at the onset of the pande mic, but today we have emerged as the \\nsecond-largest producer of PPE  kits in the world. Cha llenges were many, but with \\na sustained push by the gove rnment, businesses and other stakeholders were able to \\nproduce over 5 lakh PPE kits per day. Today, we are in a position to export them to \\nseveral countries.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='This story needs to be replicated in o ther fields to create a truly ‘Atmanirbhar \\nBharat’. This was Dr. Kalam’s dream and he  dedicated his entire life to make India \\nself-reliant in defence and space technologies.  \\nSimilar were his concerns for the environ ment. He repeatedly said that we have \\nonly one livable planet in our solar system . It is our duty to protect the earth and \\nleave a livable planet for our future generations. Even on his last day, while \\ndelivering his lecture — “Cre ating a Livable Planet Ear th” at IIM, Shillong, he \\ncautioned humanity of the harm we have inf licted on nature in our blind quest for \\ndevelopment.  \\nThis is the time to seriousl y follow Dr. Kalam’s sagacious advice and adopt a path \\nof development that is sustainable and environment friendly.
